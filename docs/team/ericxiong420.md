### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the affiliation command, `affn`
    * What it does: Displays the affiliations of a doctor/patient
    * Justification: This feature adds on the specific functionality for a head nurse, by allowing a nurse to find out the doctors of a patient, or the patients of a doctor.
    * Highlights: This implementation was challenging as the "tag" functionality had to be changed to "affiliation", which required project-wide renaming and refactoring, across both code and comments. The implementation required certain additions to Logic classes, and the addition of a new predicate.
