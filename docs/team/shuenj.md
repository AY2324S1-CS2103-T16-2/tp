### Project: MediSync

MediSync is a desktop app specifically used for head nurses to manage staff and patients, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). Instead of tracking data of staff and patients using existing applications such as Microsoft Excel, using a CLI-centric application like MediSync will help head nurses track and handle contact management more quickly.
